							<p>I donâ€™t really know how to start this or even say it because I have never been good at it. Am writing this (donâ€™t even know what to call it) and presenting it in the best way I can. I didnâ€™t really think of how youâ€™re gonna take
							it and most importantly what its gonna mean to what we have. 
							but there is a part of me that longs for you and I canâ€™t control it. </p>
							<p>I have been looking everywhere until I found. But when I did find you, I have never been myself again. You dont have to believe a word I say because to you am just another man. Until I prove myself worthy of your love.</p>
							<p>You remember me telling you that am afraid of
							loving again but I wasnâ€™t completely honest. In fact, it didnâ€™t apply if I was to try it with you. its okay am taking full responsibility for the outcome. </p>

						<h2 class="item__content-title">Confesion</h2>
						<h3 class="item__content-subtitle">From the Heart</h3>
						<div class="item__content-text">
							<p>Men are meant to be risk takers not cowards, because of that am trying to tell you how I feel about you. I love you as
							certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul.I love you because I know no other
							way than this.</p>
							<p>
								From the time we started dating, I understood that you are the most wonderful woman I have ever met, and only you could fill the void in my heart with your love. But the selfish guy that I am, I kept accepting your love and never gave you anything in return. You have put up with all my crazy antics and never onceÂ complained.
							</p>
							<p>I know I might never be able to hear some words from you that I wanna hear you say but Iâ€™m gonna take this risk and tell
							you how I feel. Am not really expecting you to express the same feelings back to me because love is not automatic. I
							could write a thousand words but none of them can be able to tell you the message that I wanna pass to you.</p>
							<p>My heart hurts because of what you did, but I can't stop myself from loving you. Nobody is perfect. We all have flaws that mar our outer beauty, but you areÂ perfectÂ forÂ me.I don't know what is happening to you, but I still want to be with you forever.It takes bravery for you to hurt me so badly every time but much more bravery to acceptÂ myÂ forgiveness.</p>
						
						<p>You chose to hurt me when it is easy for you to put a smile on my face. You hurt my feelings, and yet I still love you. You hurt me so badly, but I love you as much as I did when we first met. </p>

						<h2 class="item__content-title">Love</h2>
						<h3 class="item__content-subtitle">The meaning of Love</h3>
						<div class="item__content-text">
							<p>To me love means absolute trust without limit and ability to sacrifice everything for the one you love to be happy.</p>
							<p>I know you love me as your Ex or are we even ex yet? but might not be in love with me. Don't say you love me if you donâ€™t mean it. Because I might do something stupid like believing it.
							We are different in so many ways but I think our differeces have held us this long for a reason.
							</p>
							<p>My joy has always been seeing you happy and if you donâ€™t accept me; that would be absolutely fine. I donâ€™t need you to force feelings for me. I have had heartbreaks and countless sleepless nights. I donâ€™t really
							care what will happen to me but rather care about how its gonna affect you.</p>

						<h3 class="item__content-subtitle">My Final Words</h3>
						<div class="item__content-text">
							<p>Am neither a good writer nor good enough a lover for you. Am not even handsome, by the way not even close your current lover or maybe you dont even have one yet? ANASS or DANIEL ion really care. Just look at that ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†. This is just the best way I can use to tell you. I was told
							that I found love where I wasnâ€™t supposed to.</p>
							<p>They all came-in and left me broken in pieces and in pain. You never realised that you were the cure that I need to
							heal but it just seems i'm also a joke to you or is it only MAYA that think that, also i have no ill feelings against her and if she thinks i offended her, i'm actually sorry for that. You are my true love and I want it more than anything for you to be my last
							love now and forever.</p>
							<p>I'm supposed not to be saying this actually cause you we're supposed to be saying this to me but as a guy and man i'm,i will accepts all the blame about everything also i'm not asking us to come back cause it was even made before the first one i sent to you and i spent good 6 days writing and coding all this cause of what MAYA said the other day even before you said you we're no more interested but have made this thing already and i won't be happy if i don't share it with you cause i think it worths everything. <B> MY ABSOLUTE REGARDS TO MAYA FOR INSPIRING AND ADVICING ME TO DO THIS </B> </p>
							<p>I may not be the most <b>IMPORTANT</b> person in your life. But I just <b>HOPE</b> that one day when you <b>HEAR</b> my
							name, You would just <b>SMILE</b> and say "I <b>MISS</b> you very much."</p>
